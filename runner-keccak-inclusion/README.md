# zkVM Runner

This utility is to help in **development & testing** basic operations with a zkVM to convert a NMT proof to Keccak proof.
This expects a NMT proof is saved to `./proof_input.json` generated by [another utility](../blob-tool) to **test creation of a ZK proof** that ultimately the [`eq-service` provides for it's users](../README.md).

## Usage

```sh
# Expects `./proof_input.json`
RUST_LOG=debug cargo r
```
